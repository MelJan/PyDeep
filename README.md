# PyDeep
Machine learning / Deep Learning library with focus on unsupervised learning, especially Restricted Boltzmann machines. 
So why another ML lib? First of all, the library will contain code I produced during my research that allows to 
reproduce the results in corresponding publications and might also be used by other researchers. 
If you simply want to use standard algorithms, use one of the big ML libs have GPU suppport symbolic differentiation, etc. ,
this library is not meant to compete with those libs! 
There are plenty of repositories and code snipps implementing deep learnign algorithms but they are usually not documented 
very well nor do they provide unit test, which give evidence for the correctness of the code.
This lib is meant to fill the gap, well documente easy to understand code thar has plenty of unit test, which give high 
evidence for correctness.
