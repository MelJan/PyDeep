PyDeep is a machine learning / deep learning library with focus on unsupervised learning. It contains the code I have written during my PhD research allowing you to reproduce the results described in my publications.

PyDeep has a modular design, is well documented and purely written in Python/numpy. This allows you to understand, use, modify, and debug the code easily. Furthermore, its extensive use of unitests assures a high level of reliability and correctness.
