Independent Component Analysis on a 2D example.
=======================================================

Example for Independent Component Analysis (`ICA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis>`_) used for blind source separation on a linear 2D mixture.

Theory
***********

If you are new on ICA and blind source separation, a good theoretical introduction is given by the `Course Material <https://www.ini.rub.de/PEOPLE/wiskott/Teaching/Material/index.html>`_ in combination with the following video lectures.

Visualization of the whitened data with the ICA projection matrix, that is the estimation of the whitened mixing matrix.
Note that ICA is invariant to sign flips of the sources. The columns of the estimated mixing matrix are most likely a permutation of the columns of the original mixing matrix and can also be a 180 degrees rotated version (original vector multiplied by -1).
The Amari distance is invariant to permutations and flips of the matrix columns and can thus be used to compare to mixing matrices.

Amari distanca between true mixing matrix and estimated mixing matrix:

We can also project the ICA projection matrix back to the original space and compare the results in the original space.
