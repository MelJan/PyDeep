Independent Component Analysis on a natural image patches
==========================================================

Example for Independent Component Analysis (`ICA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis>`_)
on natural image patches. The independent components (columns of the ICA projection matrix) of natural image patches are edge detector filters.

Theory

If you are new on ICA and blind source separation, first see `ICA_2D_example <ICA_2D_example.html#ICA_2D_example>`__.

For a comparison of ICA and GRBMs on natural image patches see `Gaussian-binary restricted Boltzmann machines for modeling natural image statistics. Melchior et. al. PLOS ONE 2017 <http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0171015>`_.

The log-likelihood on all data is:

.. code-block:: Python

   log-likelihood on all data: -260.064878919

To analyze the optimal response of the learn filters we can fit a Gabor-wavelet parametrized in angle and frequency, and plot
the optimal grating, here for 20 filters

as well as the corresponding tuning curves, which show the responds/activities as a function frequency in pixels/cycle (left) and angle in rad (right).

Furthermore, we can plot the histogram of all filters over the frequencies in pixels/cycle (left) and angles in rad (right).
