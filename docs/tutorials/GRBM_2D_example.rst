The parameters values and the component scaling values P(h_i) are as follows:

   Visible bias:

   Sigmas:

The exact log-likelihood, annealed importance sampling estimation, and reverse annealed importance sampling estimation for training and test data are:

.. code-block:: bash

   True log partition:   1.40422867085  ( LL_train:  -2.74117592643 , LL_test:  -2.73620936613  )
   AIS  log partition:   1.40390312781  ( LL_train:  -2.74085038339 , LL_test:  -2.73588382309  )
   rAIS  log partition:  1.40644042744  ( LL_train:  -2.74338768302 , LL_test:  -2.73842112273  )

For comparison here is the original mixing matrix an the corresponding ICA estimation.

The exact log-likelihood for ICA is almost the same as that for the GRBM with 4 hidden units.

.. code-block:: bash

   ICA log-likelihood on train data: -2.74149951412
   ICA log-likelihood on test data:  -2.73579105422


We can also calculate the Amari distance between true mixing , the ICA estimation, and the GRBM estimation.
Since the GRBM has learned 4 weight vectors we calculate teh Amari distance between the true mixing matrix and all sets of 2 weight-vectors of the GRBM.

.. code-block:: bash

   Amari distance between true mixing matrix and ICA estimation:             0.00621143307663
   Amari distance between true mixing matrix and GRBM weight vector 1 and 2: 0.0292827450487
   Amari distance between true mixing matrix and GRBM weight vector 1 and 3: 0.0397992351592
   Amari distance between true mixing matrix and GRBM weight vector 1 and 4: 0.336416964036
   Amari distance between true mixing matrix and GRBM weight vector 2 and 3: 0.435997388341
   Amari distance between true mixing matrix and GRBM weight vector 2 and 4: 0.0557649366433
   Amari distance between true mixing matrix and GRBM weight vector 3 and 4: 0.0666442992135

Weight-vectors 1 and 4 as well as 2 and 3 are almost 180 degrees rotated version of each other, which can also be seen
from the weight matrix values given above and thus the Amari distance to the mixing matrix is high.
