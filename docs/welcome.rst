Welcome

PyDeep is a machine learning / deep learning library with focus on unsupervised learning.
The library has a modular design, is well documented and  purely written in Python/numpy.
This allows you to understand, use, modify, and debug the code easily. Furthermore,
its extensive use of unittests assures a high level of reliability and correctness.



The library contains code I have written during my PhD research allowing you to reproduce
the results described in the following publications.
